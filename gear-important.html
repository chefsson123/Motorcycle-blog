				<h2>How important is gear</h2>
				<p>ATGATT - All the gear, all the time.</p>
			</header>


			<p class="pp-single">Imagine walking through a building that is on fire. You can choose being in a t-shirt and shorts or in a fully fire-resistant suit, what would you pick? Think of fire as all the danger surrounding you on your ride. </p>

			<h3><strong>Even a casual ride comes with risks, so you better be prepared.</strong></h3>

			<p class="pp-single">No matter how experienced you are in motorcycling, there are inevitably times, in which you do not feel like gearing up. It Could be a simple ride to the market, a visit to a friend who lives next corner, any kind of
				low-range ride that feels like it does not require gearing up.</p>
			<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/motorcycle-mistakes.jpg" alt="" /></a>

			<p class="pp-single">In fact, a huge amount of accidents occur when riding nearby. This is the time when we are not 100% focused and may find ourselves on the ground. Hell, you can even fall down because you forgot the sidestand. It may sound
				stupid, but it happens all the time.</p>
			<p class="pp-single">It is totally up to you whether you gear up or not, but we at MotoLand have some mandatory rules of our own. One of them is - never ride without at least having a helmet and a pair of gloves. These are our top picks when
				we're talking gear. Overall, it may sound a bit disturbing, wearing gear is the difference between a few minor scratches and bearing with your wounds for the rest of your life.</p>
			<h3><strong>Always gear up, preparing for the unknown.</strong></h3>
