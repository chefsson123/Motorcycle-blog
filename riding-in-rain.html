				<h2>Riding in the rain</h2>
				<p>The riders nightmare</p>
			</header>


			<p class="pp-single">We can still not stop Mother Nature from expressing her emotions, whether it would in the form of rain, mist or snow. Rain is said to be the motorcyclist nightmare, due to the fact that we lose traction easier, we get all
				wet and is overall an unsatisfying experience. Contrary to that, a simple rain should not mean closing the garage doors, leaving our machine alone. Riding in the rain, when taken proper adjustments can actually be pretty fun!</p>


			<p class="pp-single">We have all been there. Got out sweating from the hot weather, feeling bad we put on all the gear. In the next moment, on our way back home, lightnings strike, rain is pouring everywhere, we are all wet and our boots are
				full of water. So uncomfortable! No matter how hard you avoid riding in the rain, it will eventually happen, as Mother Nature is often changing moods rapidly and will some day catch you unprepared. Alhough it is a little bit riskier,
				adjusting a few things in your riding and sticking to a few rules will make you a more experienced and confidend rider in the long run. Here are a few tips to achieve it.</p>
			<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/motorcycle-mistakes.jpg" alt="" /></a>

			<h2 class="types"><strong>Proper gear</strong></h2>

			<p class="pp-single">Like everything else associated with motorcycling, it is always gear that take the top spots. Whenever you find yourself out there in the rain, you should have already prepared yourself for these kinds of conditions.
				Waterproof gear is a must in every passionate motorcyclist's wardrobe, keeping water away, avoiding the uncomfortable riding experience. Sometimes even a cheap, thin, waterproof jacket over your regular one can be a saver.</p>


			<p class="pp-single">With rain pouring from the sky, our vision is somewhat decreased, so a clean and possibly anti-fog visor is a must. A dirty visor could reduce your vision even further and affect your riding. Wearing proper motorcycle boots
				is also necessary. Not only do they give you the biggest possible protection from heat, wind and junk on the road, they are also designed to be riden with in different weather conditions such as rain. Riding in sneakers will almost always
				lead to wet, soaked in water feet (Do not do that, it sucks).</p>
			<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/motorcycle-mistakes.jpg" alt="" /></a>

			<h2 class="types"><strong>Adjust the way you ride</strong></h2>

			<p class="pp-single">Different weather conditions require different approach! Remember that. When raining, traction could be affected, so your best option is to lower your lean angle and make smooth throttle adjustments. This will save your
				tyre from slipping and scare the crap out of you. Brakes should be used lightly and earlier than you are used to. Slowing your speed gradually will prevent you from having to jump on your brakes if something occurs, which can make your tyre
				block and lose traction.</p>



			<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/motorcycle-mistakes.jpg" alt="" /></a>

			<h2 class="types"><strong>Watch out even more</strong></h2>
			<p class="pp-single">As motorcyclists, we are used to inspecting every inch of the road in front of us. We do it in order to escape all kinds of debries and areas covered in dirt, sand and oil. Rain makes them spread through the road and make
				them invisible until the last moment. Water also lifts up all the oil soaked in the pavement, making it slippery. The best you can do is to lower your regular driving speed. Pavement markings are also worth mentioning here. Their surface may
				get slippier during rain, so the best we can do is avoid them. If you can't, just do not go through them when in a leaning position.</p>
