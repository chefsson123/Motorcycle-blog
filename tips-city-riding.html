				<h2>Tips for riding in the city</h2>
				<p>For us, it is like a jungle</p>
			</header>
			<hr>

			<p class="pp-single">Riding a motorcycle in the city traffic can be quite stressful. A million things happen every second, so you cannot let your guard down, thinking about what to eat tonight, for example.</p>


			<p class="pp-single">When you are out there on the streets you need to give all your focus and attention to your bike and to the road. Here are a few tips to ride safer in that jungle full of cars.</p>

			<h2 class="types"><strong>Think ahead.</strong></h2>


			<p class="pp-single">We, as motorcyclists should always think way ahead than car drivers are used to, as we are balancing on only two wheels. An unexpected maneuvre may catch us unprepared if we are not thinking ahead, bad stuff may happen.
				After all, we do not want to compete in crash tests versus a car.</p>

			<br>
			<p class="pp-single">Watch the other drivers'behaviour on the road. Are they slowing down with no reason? There may be an obstacle in front, or they may suddenly stop without putting the hazards on. Is there a pedestrian sidewalk infront of
				you? Slow down, a kid may suddenly appear, not to mention that if you are not ready for that, grabbing your brakes instinctively may result in a fall.</p>



			<h2 class="types"><strong>Ride as if you are invisible</strong></h2>

			<p class="pp-single">There will always be that one driver that doesn't see you. ALWAYS. By riding like others do not notice you, you are decreasing the odds of a potentional crash. Your best chances of avoiding that - ride as if they do not see
				you and position yourself to be more visible, so that they do. Try not to ride adjacent to cars. Either be in front or behind. Be alert about other vehicles' blind spots. Keep your distance and you will not get caught unprepared by other
				vehicles unexpected maneuveres.</p>

			<h2 class="types"><strong>Be aware of intersections</strong></h2>


			<p class="pp-single">Intersections is the place most drivers loosen their focus. They stop paying attention to everything that is happening around them and regularly take out their phone.</p>

			<br>
			<p class="pp-single">As you approach intesections, even if there is a green light for you, always keep track of potentional threat. Wait on it, do not rush taking off as soon as the green comes on, someone may go through a deep yellow light.
			</p>

			<h2 class="types"><strong>Have an escape lane</strong></h2>


			<p class="pp-single">Doing fast maneuvres or using the brakes hard is a potentional threat when on a motorcycle. We have only half the balancing points of cars, so a sudden problem with any of our tyres is bad news for us.</p>

			<br>
			<p class="pp-single">In city traffic, even a crash with low speed may be fatal for us. That is why it is important to have an escape route at all times. Planning it ahead gives us an opportunity to take the safe path in the last second.</p>
