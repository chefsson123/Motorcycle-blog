				<h2>6 mistakes every new rider does</h2>
				<p>How did I forget that?</p>
			</header>


			<p class="pp-single">You finally hold your motorcycle driving license in your hand and feel like the proudest person in the world. You should be, welcome to the pack! Taking it means you do know at least the basics of motorcycle riding, but do
				not get too excited, you know around 10% of what motorcycling has to offer. In fact, you know nothing. Daily driving has nothing to do with anything like the course you have taken.</p>



			<p class="pp-single">We have all been novice, we have all made mistakes. You will not be the first one, nor the last one, who for example stalled his bike. Mistakes are part of every new motorcycle enthusiast, but knowing about them earlier
				could prevent you from doing them and reduce the risk of harming yourself. Here are a few of the most common mistakes we make when we are rookies.
				<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/motorcycle-mistakes.jpg" alt="" /></a>

				<h2 class="types"><strong>Forgetting our turn signals</strong></h2>

				<p class="pp-single">Using your turn signals is essential, and still one of the most common mistakes beginner riders do. They tend to forget signaling, probably because motorcycles can rapidly switch from lane to lane. Yet you must always
					show others the direction you want to go, if you don't, you will cause yourself trouble.</p>
				<p class="pp-single">Forgetting turning them off is also a silly mistake. You have been a responsible citizen and used your signal when taking that last corner, but then you forgot about it blinking. This is a dangerous roleplay, since other
					drivers think you are showing you the direction you are going, but you are actually not and suddenly they almost go over you. Owning a car may confuse you that after the turn, your signals will self-cancel, but most bikes do not have that
					mechanism. It also does not have that click sound as your signals lighten, so always keep good track of them when near or after a turn.</p>

				<h2 class="types"><strong>Stalling your bike</strong></h2>
				<p class="pp-single">Another regular mistake, which happens not only to beginner riders, but also to experienced ones (if they are unfocused). Not a big deal though, you will get better at it each day and will soon do it effortlessly, like a
					habit. </p>
				<p class="pp-single">Stalling is usually a result of releasing the clutch too suddenly or not meeting the rev requirements of your engine when shifting gears, making your engine work under its regular capabilities. The good news is, stalling
					is not that big of a deal, still, doing it all the time will inevitably damage your machine. It is bad if it happens in the city traffic, your motorcycle could shut down, stressing you, which could lead to unfocused decisions.</p>




				<h2 class="types"><strong>Running low on fuel</strong></h2>

				<p class="pp-single">One of the inconviniences of driving a motorcycle is the lack of a fuel indicator. There usually is one, but it is just a lamp that shows us we are already too low on fuel. Rookie drivers may not notice the light came on
					and exceed the limit of the tank. Always try to have at least 1/4 amount of gas in your tank, at all times. Any lower than that may hurt your bike. Not to mention you may find yourself pushing your motorcycle for hundreds of meters, trying
					to get to the next fuel station.</p>




				<img src="images/motorycle-mistakes.jpg" alt="" class="image fit">
				<h2 class="types"><strong>Leaving the sidestand down</strong></h2>
				<p class="pp-single">This one is not that big of a deal, but it is quite annoying. Most bikes nowadays have this safe mechanism of shutting down when we try to put in first gear, without kicking up the sidestand. It happens a lot and we feel
					terrible when it does. Keep in mind that if you are driving a motorcycle that does not have this feature, it can be quite dangerous. Contacting the ground with your sidestand could either break it or suddenly change your direction and
					disbalance you, almost certainly leading to a crash.</p>



				<img src="images/motorcycle-mistakes.jpg" alt="" class="image fit">
				<h2 class="types"><strong>Not keeping track of maintenance</strong></h2>
				<p class="pp-single">With the growing number of cars driven every year, parking is a neverending problem. For car drivers, not us (ha-ha!). Since motorcycles are tinier, we can park almost everywhere, next to cars or between them, we will
					always find a spot in the next 20 yards. Some parking lots have cool features like areas designated only for motorcycles. Also, since we do not take much space, most parking lots even let us park there for free!</p>



				<h2 class="types"><strong>6. SAVING MONEY AT THE PUMP STATION</strong></h2>

				<p class="pp-single">Bikes tend to burn less fuel, due to the fact that they are lightweight compared to cars. This is what makes them some serious money savers, not to mention the ride is way more exciting. No wonder more and more people
					decide to use a motorcycle to get to work, without staying in traffic for hours, burning fuel for nothing. This leads us to our next point.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="pp-single"></p>
				<br>




				<img src="images/motorycle-mistakes.jpg" alt="" class="image fit">
				<h2 class="types"><strong>7. BYPASSING TRAFFIC</strong></h2>
				<p class="pp-single">This reason itself is enough for a lot of car drivers to switch to a two-wheeled machine. Living in a big city makes being caught in a traffic jam part of your daily routine, often making you feel irritated and often
					doing irresponsible maneuvres. Owning a motorcycle saves you the pain of sitting there for hours, or leaving home early, so that you will not be late for work.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="pp-single">Make sure to first check if filtering (going between cars) is allowed in your country. In some countries it is legal, in others it is not, after all, we do not want to get a ticket for that. Also keep in mind filtering is
					quite dangerous, some cars do not stop in the middle of the lane, leaving you with less space, sometimes impossible to go through. Another thing worth mentioning is always being ready for drivers or passengers opening their doors.</p>
				<br>



				<img src="images/motorcycle-mistakes.jpg" alt="" class="image fit">
				<h2 class="types"><strong>8. ONE OF A KIND</strong></h2>
				<p class="pp-single">When manufactured cars usually come out with only a few colors, usually pretty boring. On the other hand, motorcycles come out of the manufacturing company covered in all kinds of stickers or extraordinary paint in
					different layers. You will probably never see two bikes that are the same. Since it is easier to change parts on a motorcycle, bikers do all kinds of DIY mods on their bikes. From louder exhausts, LED lights and bigger tyres, to simple
					stickers. It is not rarely seen even combining exterior parts from different motorcycles into one. Overall, owning a motorcycle is the purest form of authencity.</p>



				<h2 class="types"><strong>9. LESS HARM TO THE ENVIRONMENT</strong></h2>

				<p class="pp-single">If you have read some of our previous articles, you already know that when we are driving a motorcycle, we are closely connected to nature, feeling all the smells, the wind, the temperature. We, as bikers, regularly go
					for some long rides out in the beautiful areas, looking for our next adventure with our dear two-wheeled buddy. Whenever you become a motorcyclist, you undoubtebly start appreciating more the colorful world surrounding you.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="pp-single">As pollution related problems are emerging more and more every ear, this could also be a reason to switch vehicles. Motorcycles use less fuel, so they pollute less. Manufacturing them is also mostly human made - less
					pollution. If you want to make the planet a better place to live, this is a small step in that direction.</p>
				<br>




				<img src="images/motorycle-mistakes.jpg" alt="" class="image fit">
				<h2 class="types"><strong>10. LEARNING TO FIX AND TAKE CARE OF THINGS</strong></h2>
				<p class="pp-single">As we said, bikes are easier to tinker with. You cannot go to the motorcycle service everytime something happens and sooner or later you start fixing it youself. Most bikers, for example, change their oil and filters in
					the yard at home. We tend to treat our motorcycles like they are our own babies. We wash them, we buy them gifts, overall we spoil them. A lot!</p>
