				<h2>Where do I start?</h2>
				<p>You have finally decided to become a motorcyclist? Good job! Welcome to the family!</p>
			</header>

			<hr>
			<p class="pp-single">In our daily routine (mostly the summer days), we regularly come across motorcyclists. There is still no scientific explanation, but almost magically motorcycles steal our attention one way or another.</p>

			<h3><strong>Most people secretly want to be part of the moto-community, but do not have the guts to become part of it.</strong></h3>

			<p class="pp-single">But you are not one of them, right? You have truly decided to join the club and there is no going back. Here are a few tips from where you could start.</p>
			<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/motorcycle-mistakes.jpg" alt="" /></a>

			<h2 class="types"><strong>Motorcycle license</strong></h2>


			<p class="pp-single">The first part of your adventure starts with signing up in some sort of driving school. Your choice of bike category depends on your age and country you live in, since they all have different laws. The majority of people
				would admit they know enough bikers without driving licenses, but trust me, you do not need that kind of a mess on your head.</p>

			<h3><strong>Riding should be all about fun and excitement, not anxiety of getting stopped by police officers on the next corner.</strong></h3>

			<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/motorcycle-mistakes.jpg" alt="" /></a>

			<h2 class="types"><strong>Buying gear</strong></h2>


			<p class="pp-single">As far as we are talking about gear, there is a saying among motorcyclists - it does not harm you, but it will save you (if something happens). Whenever you go for a ride, there is risk involved. Wouldn't you want to be
				prepared for all the unpredictable danger out there? It is totally up to you if you want to put in some extra money for the newer and higher quality products or cut some expenses and buy the cheaper ones.</p>
			<p class="pp-single">The best scenario would be if you have some saved cash in order to purchase at least the most necessary gear (a helmet and a pair of gloves).</p>

			<h3><strong>Tip: Imagine that you are on a ride, having a good time, minding your own business and suddenly you start falling. Would you rather be in an old-school protective-ish gear or the newest technological protection certified gear, that
					has been tested a hundred times before it came out on the shelves.</strong></h3>

			<p class="pp-single">Summarized, we cannot make you buy gear that you do not like or want, but at least keep this in mind - when you are out there, trying out different kinds of helmets, pants, gloves, etc., be sure to check them for protection
				certificates, this may be the difference between just a slide and missing areas of your precious skin.</p>

			<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/motorcycle-mistakes.jpg" alt="" /></a>

			<h2 class="types"><strong>Buying your first motorcycle</strong></h2>


			<p class="pp-single">This is the most exciting part of your journey into motorcycling. Ideally, you have already chosen your type of machine or you are open to the vast world of different motorcycles.</p>
			<p class="pp-single">Your bike choice highly depends on where you will regularly ride. If exploring woods and unexisting roads is your thing, go for a dirt bike. If you are going to just casually ride from point A to point B, a scooter may be
				your best choice. Going for longer amount of kilometres? A tourist or an adventure bike will get you there, without feeling discomforted. If you are an heavy adrenaline kind of person - sportbike.</p>
