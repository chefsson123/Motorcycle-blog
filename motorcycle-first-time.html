				<h2>First time on a motorcycle</h2>
				<p class="pp-single">Oooh, it is so confusing.</p>
			</header>


			<p class="pp-single">Riding a motorcycle for the first time is an amazing, yet uncomfortable experience. While it may be scary and unpleasant, believe me, it gets better each time you put your cheeks on the seat.</p>

			<p class="pp-single">Everything feels heavy as if you are trying to move a bag full of sotnes. You feel like you are not ready to lean the bike a bit to the side, not to mention to kick out the sidestand.</p>

			<h3><strong>It does sound like a nightmare, but there is no place for worries. Motorcycling is like wine, it gets better with time.</strong></h3>

			<p class="pp-single">If you ever drove a bike before, in the worst scenario - like 15 years ago, you do have some basic instructions saved in your brain, thanks to that you will get through this a little better.</p>

			<p class="pp-single">For example - you already know how to keep a good balance with or without moving. Someone who knows how to ride a bicycle and also a car, has an even bigger advantage - knows how to take off and switch gears using the
				clutch (the beginners' nightmare.</p>

			<p class="pp-single">Overall, our first contact with Motorcycles is quite a challenge. But it is undoubtebly worth all the struggle in the long run. We get used to the bike more and more each time we ride. Just do not get overwhelmed and think
				you are the king of motorcycles. That is when accidents happen and things get out of control.</p>
